Hi there! It's Nguyen Thanh Cong here :)
Currently, I'm studying here (a.k.a Tran Phu High School) as a 11A's member, and I feel
really lucky to be a part of our school :D
Now I'm working as a video editor, music producer and also a freelance developer in my free time.
SO, if you want to make a MV for your class or anything else, don't be hesitate to contact me through my social accounts here :D

// We focus on EDM, but maybe a little Trap or DnB would be okay ;))
